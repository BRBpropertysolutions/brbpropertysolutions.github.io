<h1>Landlord Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<div class="faq">
  <div class="q">Who pays the rent?</div>
  <div class="a">
    BRB Property Solutions leases the property directly and pays rent
    under the terms of the agreement, regardless of occupancy.
  </div>

  <div class="q">Who manages the tenants?</div>
  <div class="a">
    We take full responsibility for management, inspections,
    and liaison with local authorities.
  </div>

  <div class="q">Will my property be used as social housing?</div>
  <div class="a">
    Properties are supplied to local authorities for temporary
    or emergency accommodation in line with agreed standards
    and safeguarding requirements.
  </div>

  <div class="q">What about wear and tear?</div>
  <div class="a">
    Properties are inspected regularly, and condition standards
    are clearly set out within the lease agreement.
  </div>

  <div class="q">Is this rent-to-rent?</div>
  <div class="a">
    This is a professional leasing arrangement with a compliant
    operator, not a casual rent-to-rent model.
  </div>

  <div class="q">Can I exit the agreement?</div>
  <div class="a">
    Exit provisions are clearly defined within the lease
    to provide clarity for both parties.
  </div>
