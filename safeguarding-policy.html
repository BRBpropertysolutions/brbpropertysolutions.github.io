<h1>Safeguarding Policy</h1>

    of all individuals occupying accommodation we manage, including vulnerable
    adults and families placed through local authority arrangements.

  <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
  <p>
    While BRB Property Solutions does not provide regulated care or support
    services, we recognise that residents placed in temporary or emergency
    accommodation may be vulnerable. We therefore operate with safeguarding
    awareness and take reasonable steps to identify and report safeguarding
    concerns.
