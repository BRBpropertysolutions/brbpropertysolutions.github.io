<h1>Complaints & Redress Procedure</h1>

<h2>Our Commitment</h2>
<p>
BRB Property Solutions aims to deliver a professional, transparent, and
responsive service. Complaints are handled fairly, promptly, and objectively.
</p>

<h2>How to Raise a Complaint</h2>
<p>
Complaints should be submitted in writing via email or letter and include
sufficient detail to allow investigation.
</p>

<h2>Complaint Handling</h2>
<p>
All complaints are acknowledged and investigated internally. Where appropriate,
a written response will be issued outlining findings and any remedial action.
</p>

<h2>Independent Redress</h2>
<p>
If a complaint cannot be resolved internally, complainants may escalate the
matter to our independent redress provider:
